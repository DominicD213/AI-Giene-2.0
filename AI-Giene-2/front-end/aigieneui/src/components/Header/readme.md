# Header Component

The `Header` component displays the logo and title of the application, providing a simple and clean navigation bar. It is responsive and hides certain elements based on screen size, making it adaptable to different device types.

## Features

- Displays the logo and application name "Giene" in the header.
- Uses flexbox for layout to align the logo and title properly.
- Conditionally renders a separator line on larger screens.
- The logo and title are styled using utility classes, and the title color is set to white for contrast.

## Dependencies

- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-based styling and responsive design.
