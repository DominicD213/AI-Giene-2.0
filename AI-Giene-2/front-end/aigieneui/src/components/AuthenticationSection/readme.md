# AuthenticationSection Component

The `AuthenticationSection` component handles the authentication flow for users, including login, sign-up, session management, and user profile image updates. It integrates with Redux for state management and uses custom hooks to manage user actions like logging out and changing profile images.

## Features

- Displays buttons to toggle between the login and sign-up forms.
- Manages the user session, showing the user profile and a logout button when the session is active.
- Allows users to update their profile image through a file input.
- Includes error handling and redirects to the appropriate authentication view based on the user's session.

## Dependencies

This component relies on the following libraries and hooks:

- **react-redux**: For state management with Redux.
- **React**: For rendering and state handling.
- **Custom hooks**: 
  - `useHandleImageChanges`: Handles profile image updates.
  - `useHandleLogout`: Manages user logout.
