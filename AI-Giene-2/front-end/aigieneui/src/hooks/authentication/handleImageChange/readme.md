useHandleImageChanges Hook

Overview

The useHandleImageChanges hook is responsible for handling image selection, previewing the selected image, and uploading it automatically. It integrates with Redux to store and preview user images while also leveraging an image upload service.

Functionality

Listens for image file selection from an <input> element.

Creates an object URL for previewing the selected image.

Dispatches the selected image to Redux for preview and storage.

Automatically uploads the image to a designated server.

Cleans up the object URL after a delay to prevent memory leaks.

Features

Image Preview: Generates a preview of the selected image using URL.createObjectURL().

Redux Integration: Updates the Redux store with the selected image and its preview.

Automatic Upload: Uploads the image using the useHandleImageUpload hook.

Error Handling: Logs errors if the file selection or upload process fails.

Object URL Cleanup: Revokes the created object URL after 5 seconds to free up resources.

Dependencies

This hook relies on:

React Redux: For state management.

useHandleImageUpload: A custom hook for handling image uploads.

Redux Actions:

setUserImage: Stores the selected image in Redux.

setImagePreview: Updates the preview image in Redux.
Implementation Details

Function handleImageChange(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)

Retrieves the selected file from the input event.

Logs the file selection.

Creates an object URL for previewing the image.

Dispatches the object URL to Redux for preview and storage.

Uploads the image asynchronously.

Handles any upload errors.

Cleans up the object URL after 5 seconds to prevent memory leaks.

Error Handling

If no file is selected, logs an error message.

If an error occurs during the upload, logs the error.

Notes

The cleanup mechanism ensures efficient memory usage by revoking the object URL after a set timeout.

The hook should only be used with file input elements that accept images.

It assumes useHandleImageUpload correctly handles image uploads and returns a response.
