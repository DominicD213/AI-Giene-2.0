        <p>
            The <code>config.cjs</code> file serves as the main controller for managing environment variables defined in the 
            <code>.env</code> file. It ensures that all necessary application requirements are met, validating that the data 
            provided is complete and in the correct format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, this file acts as the central hub for accessing and managing environment variables throughout the 
            application, promoting consistency and maintainability.
